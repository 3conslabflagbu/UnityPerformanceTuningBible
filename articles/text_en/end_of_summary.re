={end_of_summary} CONCLUSION
This is the end of this document. 
We hope that through this book, those of you who are "not confident about performance tuning" have come to think, "I kind of get it, and I want to try it. 
As more people practice it in their projects, they will be able to deal with problems much faster, and the stability of their projects will increase. 

You may also encounter complex events that cannot be solved with the information presented in this book. 
But even in such cases, what you will do will be the same. 
You will still need to profile, analyze the cause, and take some action. 

From this point forward, please make full use of your own knowledge, experience, and imagination through practice. 
I hope you will enjoy performance tuning in this way. 
Thank you for reading to the end.
