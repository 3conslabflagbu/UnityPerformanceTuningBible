## About Translations
### Background
We have received several requests for a translated version of Issues, but we have decided that it is operationally difficult to release an official translated version.  
Instead, we have decided to leave the translation to individual users.  

However, in the interest of improving translation service quality, we have explored the possibility of using such services to provide a translated version.  
As a result, we have found that we can provide the original text in Re:VIEW Format, along with future updates, using DeepL.  

Please note that only English is currently supported as a target language for translation.

### Translations in Other Languages
For translations in other languages, we kindly ask that individuals take care of the translation themselves.  
We have summarized the workflow for creating translated versions in each language in this [README](https://github.com/CyberAgentGameEntertainment/UnityPerformanceTuningBible/tree/main/translation).
By changing the language parameter, you can obtain the desired translated PDF.

### Notes
The quality of the translation depends on DeepL.  
Please note that we provide translations with the assumption that it may be more convenient for users than doing translations individually.

### Updates
We will update the translated version for major changes or additions, but not for typos.
